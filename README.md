# The_game-SDL2
## a simple game made in C++ using SDL2
welcome to The_Game! In this game you play as a black square trying to get to green square to procced to the next level, however there will be red and orange rectangles getting in your way (red are stationary, orange are moving). As the game progresses "triggers" will show up. Trigger is a rectangle of any color, wich can do almost anything when you or moving enemy collides with them. Can you make it through all the 15 challenging levels?
  I made this game mainly to learn about the SDL2 library and to practice C++.
